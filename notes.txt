Rookie uses bitboards for board representation. Each piece (defined by the piece
type and its color gets a bitboard, as do empty squares on the board.

The `Square` type encodes a square on the board, and maps to a (row, column).
The top left square from the white player's perspective (the square with the
black queenside rook, A8) is (0, 0) and the bottom right square (the white kingside
rook square, H1) is (7, 7)
